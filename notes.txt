Approach:

First get the records from the database, create email content for them and store it in a job queue. Have used Gearman for it. Emails are send with job workers.

Calculation while making script live(As per to process data)
considering if 10 emails are send in 1sec, that means we can send 10 * 60 * 60 = 36000 emails with script in 1 hour. so number of workers that we need to create is calulated as follows

No of workers = (no. of users to send email/ 360000)
According to the above calculation we can add workers in supervisor

Testing Data. I havetested my script with the folloeing data. I wasnt able to increase teh number of processors because of my system hardware constraints
No. of users to send email = 1 crore
Number of workers = 30



***********************************************************************************************
List of files and its purpose. Debug Flag is just added for testing purpose.I have added sent column in users table just for testing pupose

1) sendNewsletter.php

	1) Makes Gearman client 
	2) Forloop which sets a offset
	3) Gets the data from the database as per the offset and limit 
	4) Once we get the resultset, those records are processed to get email content and are added as a background task.

Note: Limit and number of times forloop should run can be changed as per the number of records we need to process


2) users.php
	1) contains function 'getBody' which returns the email content of the user on teh basis of email passed.

3) usersDb.php
	1) Establishes a datbase connection
	2) function getUsersList - gets users on the basis of offset and limit
	3) function markEmailsSent - update flag as sent whose background job is added

4) communication.php
	1) function sendEmail -  will contain code to send an email

5) sendEmailServer.php
	1) Makes a Gearman worker which calls the communication-sendEmail function to send Emails

6) supervisord.conf
    It is userd to monitor and control a number of processes.
